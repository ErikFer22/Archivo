In this file, I will explain why this file is secure against the FileUpload practice.

First of all, in the repository, we process uploaded files in 'process_evaluation.php.'

Starting from the first line of code, which is:

```ruby
if ($_SERVER["REQUEST_METHOD"] == "POST")
```

This checks if the request to the script is of type POST. In this case, we expect the form data to be sent using the POST method.

```ruby
$target_file = $target_dir . uniqid() . basename($_FILES["evidence"]["name"]);
```

It ensures that each uploaded file has a unique name. This is important to avoid possible naming collisions, especially if multiple users upload files at the same time. uniqid() generates a unique identifier based on the current timestamp, making it unlikely to be repetitive.

```ruby
$fileType = strtolower(pathinfo($target_file, PATHINFO_EXTENSION));
```

It retrieves the file extension (in lowercase) to determine its MIME type.

Although the HTML form specifies that only PDF files are allowed (accept=".pdf"), MIME type validation provides an additional layer of security. A malicious user might attempt to upload a file with a modified extension to bypass restrictions. By checking the MIME type, we ensure that the file actually matches the indicated extension.

```ruby
if ($_FILES["evidence"]["size"] > 2 * 1024 * 1024) { echo "El archivo es demasiado grande. Tamaño máximo permitido: 2MB."; } else { ... }
```

It checks that the file size does not exceed 2 megabytes, which is sufficient for uploading a simple screenshot in a PDF."
